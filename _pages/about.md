I am excited about computer science, primarily work with making intelligent systems.<br>
I work as a **Research Scientist** @ Arya.ai. We help financial institutes to help automate decision making tasks from underwriting, life insurances, health claims etc.<br>
I also spent time at **IIT Madras** as a Project Associate, where I worked on user controlled image inpainting. Our approach was based on Conditional WGAN.My internship @ Caterpillar India Pvt Ltd was focussed on multiple topics, object localisation in machine drawings, and generating images from text.
